# Friend Finder with Friends!

#### How does it Work?

The idea is a simple compatbility quiz. The user will begin the quiz and fill out questions as honestly as they can. The quiz is not timed and is themed after the different characters of the hit 90s sitcom, Friends. After hitting submit, the answers the user inputs will be compared with an array of object of characters and return the character most compatible with the user.

One more thing: The quiz will not submit unless an image and name are provided.
